THIS.IS.IoT.Keystone is a simple-to-use yet powerful, secure, reliable and low-power IoT sensor device communication platform. It is designed to run on the THIS.IS.IoT.Keystone hardware boards and modules aimed at building secure "sensor to cloud" IoT solutions.  The THIS.IS.IoT.Keystone firmware and hardware platform uniquely utilizes the long-range Smart City and Industrial IoT appropriate sub-GHz band by making available both 6LoWPAN mesh-style and LoRaWAN network capability to the same application.  THIS.IS.IoT.Keystone is built on *open* and *standardized* communication and security protocols that will power the next phase of global interoperable IoT.

## IoT.Keystone Platform Firmware Features

* Supports 6LoWPAN IPv6 mesh stack standard and CC1352 802.15.4 sub-GHz radio.
* Integrates latest Semtech LoRaWAN stack standard for SX1262 LoRa radio.
* Supports dynamic BLE-compatible beacon generation.
* Elliptic curve crypto engine for securely signing authentic transactions to the cloud.
* Supports a variety of popular cloud data platforms.
* Supports a comprehensive array of sensors, including:
  * Acceleration
  * Gyroscope
  * Magnetometer
  * Light 
  * Sound 
  * Temperature
  * Pressure
  * Humidity
  * Magnetic Hall effect
* Console interface
* Variety of example applications including:
  * LoRaWAN-to-cloud
  * mesh-to-cloud
  * data logger
  * dynamic beacon
  

* Mesh communication offers solution builders a medium range, lower latency and bi-directional communication channel for sensing and control applications.

* LoRaWAN offers solution builders a long range smart-city sensor reporting channel that is growing in popularity around the world.

IoT-Keystone is based on Contiki-NG: an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. It focuses on dependable (secure and reliable) low-power communication and standard protocols, such as IPv6/6LoWPAN, 6TiSCH, RPL, and CoAP.  IoT-Keystone adds a number of new features to Contiki-NG, including a LoRaWAN MAC.
