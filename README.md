IoT-Keystone is based on Contiki-NG: an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. It focuses on dependable (secure and reliable) low-power communication and standard protocols, such as IPv6/6LoWPAN, 6TiSCH, RPL, and CoAP. Contiki-NG comes with extensive documentation, tutorials, a roadmap, release cycle, and well-defined development flow for smooth integration of community contributions.

IoT-Keystone is a simple-to-use yet powerful and secure IoT sensor device communication platform designed to run on the This. Is. IoT. Keystone hardware modules aimed at building "sensor to cloud" IoT solutions.  The This. Is. IoT. Keystone firmware and hardawre platform "owns" the sub-GHz band by offering both mesh and LoRaWAN communication options in the same application.

* Mesh communication offers solution builders a medium range, lower latency and bi-directional communication channel for sensor and control applications.

* LoRaWAN offers solution builders a long range smart-city sensor reporting channel that is growing in popularity around the world.
